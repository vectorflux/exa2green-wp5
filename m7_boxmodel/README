This is a new major release of ECHAM6, "echam-6.1.00"
=====================================================

Fitness of the code
-------------------
echam-6.1.00 contains the ECHAM6 atmospheric model and the JSBACH land vegetation model.
echam-6.1.00 was used by itself and as part of the Earth system model MPI-ESM for the
CMIP5 simulations executed at DKRZ. 

For CMIP5 ECHAM6 has been used at two resolutions:
- T63L47 in the MPI-ESM-LR configuration, and 
- T63L95 in the MPI-ESM-MR configuration

echam-6.1.00 has been tested to compile on "Blizzard" at DKRZ 
using the IBM/xlf13.1.0.2 compiler.

SVN references:
- tags/echam-6.1.00 = revision r2593 on trunk/echam-dev

Changes with respect to version "echam-6.1.nn"
-----------------------------------------------------------
n/a

Compared to the CMIP5 output data the results remain unchanged 
using default settings. 
Using cdo diff leads to zero differences for all variables of the
echam-stream only (due to extensive changes in jsbach).


Known issues
------------
- echam6 will produce bit identical output data after a restart compared 
  to a run that was not interrupted by a restart if and only if the 
  calculation of the radiation coincides with the restart date

Release plan
------------
- Minor updates for bug fixes, tuning adjustments and optimizations
  are collected on a weekly base and will produce echam-6.1.nn versions.

- Major updates changing the physical formulation are collected twice
  a year, typically in December and June, and will produce echam-6.m.00 versions.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------


INSTALLATION
------------

ECHAM6 is doing IO for the initial and restart files based on UCAR's 
netCDF (see http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/packages/netcdf).  Take care 
that you use the right setup for your Fortran compiler when installing 
netCDF.

Configuration files for a number of operating systems and/or compilers
are provided in the config directory. Please check your system's
configuration file and edit it according to your needs.

In the machine specific mh-'file' you have to set the variable NETCDFROOT 
to the netCDF root directory on your machine.

For use of the parallelized version you have to set the MPIROOT path
and the MPI-LIB libary information in the respective mh-'file' which enables a 
compilation with MPI.

For postprocessing of the ECHAM6 code you need the afterburner software
package. For dokumentation and download of the latest revision see
https://code.zmaw.de/projects/afterburner

COMPILING AND RUNNING
---------------------

To compile and run echam6 cd to echam6/contrib/generate-scripts and follow
