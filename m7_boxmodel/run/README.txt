* backup_runscript_echam6-hammoz/ contains an example of a basic runscript for blizzard, DKRZ (as of 2012-09-30). It has been created as a 'backup solution' in case the echam(-hammoz) jobscript toolkit is not available on your platform, but it is strongly recommended to install and use the jobscript toolkit instead of this. More details in backup_runscript_echam6-hammoz/README.txt

* echam6_inherited/ contains files inherited from echam6 (run/*), but currently useless for echam6-hammoz
