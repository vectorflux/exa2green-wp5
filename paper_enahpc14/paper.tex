\begin{abstract}
  In  this paper we  present the  energy-to-solution and  profiling of
  COSMO-ART on various  platforms.  This model is an  extension of the
  operational  weather forecast  model of  the German  weather service
  (DWD), developed for the  evaluation of the interactions of reactive
  gases  and aerosol  particles with  the state  of atmosphere  at the
  regional scale.  The overall  performance of this application on HPC
  systems is analysed  by a profiling study to  determine hotspots and
  identify  critical  CPU paths.   Moreover,  we describe  measurement
  devices and energy-aware techniques  employed to evaluate the energy
  footprint of the considered application and to get detailed insights
  about power bottlenecks.  Our motivation is to improve corresponding
  code    sections   to    sustain   performance    while   minimising
  energy-to-solution.   This  preliminary  work  sets  the  basis  for
  subsequent studies to tackle  challenges related to energy efficient
  high performance computing in the framework of the Exa2Green project
  (\url{http://exa2green.eu/}).
