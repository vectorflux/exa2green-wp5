\begin{abstract}
  In this  paper we investigate  the energy footprint  and performance
  profiling  of  \textsc{COSMO-ART} on  various  HPC platforms.   This
  model is an  extension of the operational weather  forecast model of
  the German  weather service (DWD),  developed for the  evaluation of
  the interactions  of reactive gases  and aerosol particles  with the
  state of  atmosphere at  the regional scale.   Different measurement
  devices and  energy-aware techniques are described  to evaluate both
  time and  energy to  solution of the  considered application  and to
  gain detailed insights into power and performance requirements.  Our
  motivation  is to  improve  corresponding code  sections to  sustain
  performance  while minimising energy-to-solution.   This preliminary
  work  sets the  basis for  subsequent studies  to  tackle challenges
  related  to  energy  efficient  high performance  computing  in  the
  framework of the Exa2Green project \citep{EXA2GREEN}.
