While anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions are driving unprecedented
major  climate  changes  since   the  mid-20$^{th}$  Century,  one  factor
overwhelmingly  affects  the  uncertainty  in  defining  human-induced
radiative  forcing:  the  effects   of  aerosols  in  the  atmosphere.
Although they  are not considered  heat-trapping greenhouse  gases and
have  shorter  atmospheric lifetimes,  aerosols  significantly modify  the
global   radiation   budget   \citep{IPCC-2013}.   Enhanced   aerosols
concentrations impact the climate  system by scattering and absorption
of solar radiation, thereby exerting a direct radiative forcing; or by
modifying cloud  properties,  cloud  fraction and  surface
albedo,  causing  a  negative  indirect  radiative  forcing.   Despite
considerable  progress in  global aerosol  modelling \citep{Mann-2013}
and  measurement-based  assessments,  large  uncertainties  remain  in
current  estimates  of  aerosol radiative  forcing  \citep{Myhre-2013,
IPCC-2013,  Lee-2013,   Randles-2013,  Rosenfeld-2013,  Sherwood-2013,
Stier-2013}.

Hence to  improve our understanding of  aerosol-cloud interactions and
reduce  these  uncertainties,  the  research  community  is  making  a
concerted international  effort to represent  the underlying physical,
chemical  and aerosol dynamical  processes through  numerical chemical
transport  models (CTMs)  such  as ART  (Aerosols  and Reactive  Trace
gases),   developed   at  the   Karlsruhe   Institute  of   Technology
(KIT)  \citep{Vogel-2009,  Bangert-2011,  Knote-2013}.  This  regional
scale modelling system is coupled  with the operational  weather forecast
model  \textsc{Cosmo}  \citep{Baldauf-2011},  jointly developed  by  a
consortium of European weather centers and also used in a climate version
by the wider research community.

The extended  atmospheric model \textsc{Cosmo-art}  is com\-put\-ationally
much  more  demanding than  \textsc{Cosmo}  since  a  large number  of
additional  tracers and  processes have  to be  considered.   Thus the
model  is currently  severely-limited  in terms  of applicability  and
expensive in terms of energy consumption.  Although \textsc{Cosmo} has
recently been ported to GPUs \citep{Gysi-2014, Lapillonne-2014} within
the framework of the  High Performance and High Productivity Computing
(HP2C) Initiative  \citep{HP2C} to optimise it  for computational and
energy efficiency,  significant investments in ART  are still required
to take it  to a similar level.  The  efficiency of \textsc{Cosmo-art}
is being  addressed in the  EU Exa2Green project  \citep{EXA2GREEN} to
deliver a  prototype code, which  provides an energy efficiency  of at
least five times of the  baseline value.  Such an implementation would
allow  the  community  to  investigate critical  questions  at  higher
resolution  and   over  longer  periods,   at  reduced  cost   to  the
environment.

This  work is  organized as  follows: in  Sec.~\ref{sec:1} we  give an
overview  of  related  work,   then  in  Sec.~\ref{sec:2}  we  briefly
introduce \textsc{Cosmo-art}  and specify its  technical setup related
to  the investigated  performance and  energy evaluation  methods.  In
Sec.~\ref{sec:3}   we  describe   HPC  platforms,   power  measurement
equipments   and  software  environment   employed  to   conduct  this
benchmarking study.  Sec.~\ref{sec:4}  presents performance and energy
requirements  of the  baseline on  these architectures  and highlights
areas where improvements will be necessary for the subsequent baseline
refactoring.   Finally,  we  conclude in Sec.~\ref{concl} with some 
implications for the Exa2Green project and give an outlook for future
research.
