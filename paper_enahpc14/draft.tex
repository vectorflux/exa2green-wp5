\begin{abstract}
  In this paper we present  COSMO-ART, an extension of the operational
  weather  forecast  model  of   the  German  Weather  Service  (DWD),
  developed for  the evaluation of the interactions  of reactive gases
  and aerosol particles  with the state of atmosphere  at the regional
  scale. It  includes secondary aerosols,  directly emitted components
  like  soot,  mineral  dust,  sea  salt and  biological  material  as
  pollen. Processes such  as emissions, coagulation, condensation, dry
  deposition,  wet removal,  and sedimentation  of aerosols  are taken
  into account.   The overall performance  of this application  on HPC
  systems is  analysed by a  profiling and tracing study  to determine
  hotspots, i.e.  the  parts of the program that  require the dominant
  fraction of runtime, and to identify critical paths, i.e.  sequences
  of functions that shows dominant inclusive contributions for all its
  elements. Moreover, we describe measurement devices and energy-aware
  techniques  employed  to  evaluate   the  energy  footprint  of  the
  considered  application and  to  get detailed  insights about  power
  bottlenecks.  Our approach is to improve corresponding code sections
  to  sustain high  performance  while minimizing  energy-to-solution.
  This preliminary  study sets the basis of  broader considerations to
  tackle challenges  related to energy efficient HPC  in the framework
  of the Exa2Green project (\url{http://exa2green.eu/}).
