\begin{abstract}
  In this  paper we investigate  the energy footprint  and performance
  profiling of \cosmoart  on various HPC platforms.  This  model is an
  extension of  the operational weather  forecast model of  the German
  weather  service   (DWD),  developed  for  the   evaluation  of  the
  interactions of reactive gases  and aerosol particles with the state
  of atmosphere at the  regional scale.  Different measurement devices
  and energy-aware techniques are  described to evaluate both time and
  energy  to  solution  of  the  considered application  and  to  gain
  detailed  insights  into power  and  performance requirements.   Our
  motivation  is to  improve  corresponding code  sections to  sustain
  performance  while minimising energy-to-solution.   This preliminary
  work  sets the  basis for  subsequent studies  to  tackle challenges
  related  to  energy  efficient  high performance  computing  in  the
  framework of the Exa2Green project \cite{EXA2GREEN}.
