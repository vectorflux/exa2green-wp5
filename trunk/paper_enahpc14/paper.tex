\begin{abstract}
  In this paper we present  COSMO-ART, an extension of the operational
  weather  forecast  model  of   the  German  weather  service  (DWD),
  developed for  the evaluation of the interactions  of reactive gases
  and aerosol particles  with the state of atmosphere  at the regional
  scale. It  includes secondary aerosols,  directly emitted components
  like  soot,  mineral  dust,  sea  salt and  biological  material  as
  pollen. Processes such  as emissions, coagulation, condensation, dry
  deposition,  wet removal,  and sedimentation  of aerosols  are taken
  into account.   The overall performance  of this application  on HPC
  systems is analysed  by a profiling study to  determine hotspots and
  identify critical paths.   Moreover, we describe measurement devices
  and  energy-aware   techniques  employed  to   evaluate  the  energy
  footprint of the considered application and to get detailed insights
  about power bottlenecks.  Our motivation is to improve corresponding
  code   sections  to  sustain   high  performance   while  minimizing
  energy-to-solution.   This  preliminary  work  sets  the  basis  for
  subsequent studies to tackle  challenges related to energy efficient
  high performance computing in the framework of the Exa2Green project
  (\url{http://exa2green.eu/}).
