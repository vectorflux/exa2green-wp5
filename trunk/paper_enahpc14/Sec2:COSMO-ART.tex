\subsection{Model Description}
\label{subsec:1.1}
The  model  system COSMO-ART  described  in  \citep{Vogel-2009}, is  a
regional  to  continental scale  model  coupled  online  to the  COSMO
numerical weather  prediction and climate  model \citep{Baldauf-2011}.
It  incorporates  sophisticated  modules  for  gaseous  chemistry  and
aerosol dynamics  and allows the online calculation  of reactive trace
substances    and    their    interaction    with    the    atmosphere
\citep{Knote-2011}.  Detailed  model   description  can  be  found  in
\citep{Stanelle-2010, Bangert-2012, Knote-2011, Knote-2013}.

\subsection{Model Setup}
\label{subsec:1.2}
Establishing effective energy performance benchmarking of a code under
intense development such as COSMO-ART is a challenging task because of
the  absolute necessity that  results must  be reproducible  within an
expected  variance for the  duration of  the Exa2Green  project. After
consultation  with  the  climate  community  to  properly  define  the
baseline,  it was  necessary to  find a  run-configuration  capable of
being recreated in all subsequent versions of the code.

Thus, we give here a brief  overview of the main features of the model
setup for  our benchmark's daily  runs.  Three-dimensional simulations
are performed over  Europe for April 13th 2010, which  is close to the
equinox and thus  brings benefits of having approximately  half day of
night  and half  day  of  sun exposure,  therefore  ensuring a  proper
activation of the chemistry cycle. We consider daily 24-hour forecasts
without  any  previous spin-up  simulations.   The calculation  domain
corresponds to  the CORDEX-EU-44  domain and is  covered by a  grid of
$222\times   216$    points   with   a    horizontal   resolution   of
$0.22\,^{\circ}$,  i.e.  50  km in  both directions,  and  40 vertical
layers.  COSMO-ART requires the following input data:

\begin{itemize}
\item  Gas phase:  Anthropogenic emissions  for different  species and
  land use data for biogenic emissions and deposition,
\item Aerosol particles: Anthropogenic emissions,
\item Mineral dust: Soil specific land use data.
\end{itemize}

The meteorological initial and  bounday conditions are obtained by the
the ECMWF  global spectral model IFS  with an update  frequency of 3h.
Boundary data  for gas-phase species are taken  from IFS-MOZART output
at   6h  temporal   resolution.   NAMELIST-input   specifying  runtime
parameters    splitted   into    several   groups    are    given   in
Table~\ref{tab:1}.   The model setup  incorporates 34  2-d and  45 3-d
fields  to  be  written  out  every  hour  and  doesn't  include  data
assimilation methods.

This COSMO-ART version is configured with a semi Lagrangian horizontal
advection  scheme with  tricubic interpolation  and  selective filling
diffusion  option  in  combination   with  the  dynamical  core  using
Runge-Kutta time stepping \citep{}.  It  also makes use of the Kinetic
PreProcessor solver (KPP) for  the resolution of atmospheric chemistry
ordinary  differential equations \citep{Damian-2002}.   Concerning the
modelling  of  wet  deposition  in  aerosols, the  baseline  has  only
indirect  cloud  feedbacks  but  doesn't include  in-cloud  scavenging
(rainout) and below-cloud  scavenging (washout) yet.  Amongst physical
parameterisations,   precipitation  formation   is   performed  by   a
two-moment  cloud  microphysics scheme  instead  of  a classical  bulk
microphysics scheme.
