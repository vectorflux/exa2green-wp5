This is KPP version 2.2.1 with an additional Rosenbrock integrator, rosenbrock_posdef_h211b_qssa 
as proposed and implemented by D. Taraborrelli & G. Fanourgakis within PRACE WP8.


The only differences to 2.2.1 are:

* gen.c: Added Fun_Split function
* int:   Added rosenbrock_posdef_h211b_qssa.f90 and *.def

To make use of the new integrator, 
* export KPP_HOME=/your/path/to/this/folder/
* type make 
* go to your application and set your INTEGRATOR 
  #INTEGRATOR rosenbrock_posdef_h211b_qssa
  in your *.kpp File.
* and generate kpp code with your new kpp command in bin.
